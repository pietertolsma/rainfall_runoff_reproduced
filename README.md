For the course Deep Learning (CS4240) we attempt to reproduce the results from the paper “Rainfall–runoff modelling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks”. In this paper, a LSTM network 
model is trained to predict rainfall in a hydrological catchment based on various input parameters such as rainfall and temperature. In order to reproduce the results, we first recreate the dataset 
through combining online sources and cleaning the data. Next, we attempt to implement the model that is described in the paper using PyTorch. Finally, we compare our results from training the model 
to the results that we found in the paper in order to conclude whether this paper is reproducible or not. It turns out that this paper is highly reproducible.
